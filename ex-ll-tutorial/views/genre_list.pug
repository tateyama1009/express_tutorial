    1You will need to edit genre_list() in /controllers/genreController.js. 
    2The implementation is almost exactly the same as the author_list() controller.
     Sort the results by name, in ascending order.
    3The template to be rendered should be named genre_list.pug.
    4The template to be rendered should be passed the variables title ('Genre List') and genre_list (the list of genres returned from your Genre.find() callback.
    5The view should match the screenshot/requirements above (this should have a very similar structure/format to the Author list view, except for the fact that genres do not have dates).
